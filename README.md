# NEURONIX: Brain Tumor Detection and 3D Visualization

NEURONIX is a deep learning-based application that detects brain tumors from 2D MRI scan images and provides a 3D visualization for enhanced diagnostic support.

## Features

- **2D MRI Scan Analysis**: Detects presence of brain tumors using convolutional neural networks (CNN).
- **3D Volume Reconstruction**: Converts slices of 2D images into a 3D model for improved visualization.
- **User-Friendly Workflow**: Simplifies the tumor detection pipeline from raw image input to 3D visualization.

## Dataset

This project uses an open-source dataset of MRI brain scans labeled for tumor presence.

- **Classes**: Tumor / No Tumor
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation)

> The dataset is already included in the repository using Git Large File Storage (LFS).
